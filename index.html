<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage" target="_blank" title="information">Cabbage</a> (comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as <strong>an annual <u>vegetable</u></strong> crop for its dense-leaved heads. <p><p style="margin-top:40px;">It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var. oleracea), and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var. sabauda).</p>
